#### Create a day of the week translator.</br>
Your program should read a variable called “dayNumber”, </br>
and print (with console.log) the corresponding day of the week, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.</br>
For any other values, your program should print “Invalid day number”.</br>
Test your program for all week days values.
